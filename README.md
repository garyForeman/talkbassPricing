Requirements
------------
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- PyQuery

Use of `priceParse.py` has been depricated in preference of regular expressions.
So this file is no longer necessary for running `prices.py`.
`prices.py` creates a png file containing a 
histogram of the prices read from the specified talkbass classifieds section.
