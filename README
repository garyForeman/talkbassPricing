If you wish to run this code, make sure priceParse.py and prices.py are in the
same directory because priceParse.py is imported by prices.py. Make sure both
these files have executable permissions, and run by typing ./prices.py at the
command line. prices.py creates a png file containing a histogram of the prices
read from the specified talkbass classifieds section.

required python libraries:
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
time
urllib
